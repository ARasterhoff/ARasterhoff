Hi, I’m **Alex**, a developer.

I enjoy the creative side of UX and web development, as well as the technical challenges of backend work. I like building software that solves practical problems in practical ways.

I work with:
- HTML5 and CSS (including Tailwind CSS)
- JavaScript with lightweight, practical tools like Alpine.js  
- PHP 8, including database connections and data manipulation  
- WordPress and its ecosystem of practical plugins
