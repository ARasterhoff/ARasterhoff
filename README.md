Hi, I’m **Alex**, a developer.

I enjoy the creative side of UX and web development, as well as the technical challenges of backend work. I like building software that solves practical problems in practical ways.

###I work with: 
- HTML5 and CSS (including Tailwind CSS)
- JavaScript with lightweight, practical tools like Alpine.js  
- PHP 8, including database connections and data manipulation  
- Git for version management and development workflow  


### Getting into / Interested in
- **WordPress with plugins**, because it enables building slick websites while still allowing customers to manage their own content.  
- **Python**, particularly for web scraping.
